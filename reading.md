## How HTML, CSS, & JavaScript Fit Together
* **HTML** (.html) This is where the content of the page lives.
* The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.
**CSS** (.css) for the design of the page
**JavaScript** (.js) This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

### How to use objects & methods
The document object represents the entire web page. All web browsers implement this object, and you can use it just by giving its name.
* document.write('Good afternoon!');
* The write() method of the document object allows new content to be written into the page where the < script> element sits.
* JavaScript runs where it is found in the HTML
* when the browser comes across a < script> element, it stops load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.

**Basic JavaScript Instructions**
* Statements
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over, indicating that it should move to the next step.

* Comments
You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.

* Variables
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.

Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. programmers say that you declare the variable.

**Data Types**
* numbers : The numeric data type handles numbers.
* string Data Type: The strings data type consists of letters and other characters.
* Boolean Data Type : Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false.
